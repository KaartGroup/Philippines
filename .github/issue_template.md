## Tasking Manager
The [Kaart Data Team](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Kaart#Kaart_Data_Team) in conjunction with community mappers will work to digitize missing geometry to improve the overall road network in XYZ.

### Scope of Editing
The bulk of the work deals with creating missing geometry, however, we are also concerned with ensuring that the features have the correct attributes and are the correct classification. Additionally, the data should be as free of errors as possible - namely having appropriate connectivity and alignment. Any other issues encountered by the editor should be resolved using the standardized guidelines outlined by the [OSM Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highways "OSM"), [Philippines Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Philippines/Mapping_conventions "PH") and the Kaart [Data Team Guidelines](https://github.com/KaartGroup/Philippines/blob/master/KAART.md#data-team-guidelines
 "Guidelines").

### Validation
The JOSM validation tool is used to [validate errors and warnings](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Validator#Validations "Validators") that may have been created during the editing process. The contributor will run this validation and fix any errors or warnings prior to any changes being uploaded.

### Contributors
The project is open to OpenStreetMap contributors of any experience level.
