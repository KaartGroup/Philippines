# Philippines Mapping Projects
This repository tracks the various mapping projects throughout Philippines that are managed by [Kaart](https://github.com/KaartGroup/Philippines/blob/master/KAART.md "Kaart").

## Projects

### [Road Network Improvement Project](https://github.com/KaartGroup/Philippines/projects/1 "Project 1")
Using GIS analysis tools, we identified areas where we believe there are missing roads. The purpose of this project is to digitize missing roads in those areas and ensure a high quality road network.

We will additionally get in touch with the [talk-ph](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-ph) mailing list to ask for suggestions and feedback.

#### Contributors
The project is open to OpenStreetMap contributors of any experience level.
