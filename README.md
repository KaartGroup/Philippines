## Information about:

* Data Improvement [Projects](https://github.com/mapamore/kaart-ph/projects) in the Philippines being worked on by Kaart collaborators, or the  [Data Team](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Kaart#Kaart_Data_Team).   

##  Data Team Guidelines
In addition to the rules that apply to everyone in the community, here are the guidelines the Kaart team reiterates and adds for themselves:

- Our motto is **Make Awesome Data.** We seek to make the best map data and adhere to the highest standards as documented on the [OpenStreetMap Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org), or as established as common practice in the community.
- **Local knowledge first.** We travel and collect our own source data using gps enabled cameras and staff in-country.
- All **full-time data team members** are listed on the OpenStreetMap Wiki [Kaart](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Kaart#Kaart_Data_Team) page and identified on their user profiles. [Here](https://github.com/mapamore/kaart-ph/wiki/Kaart-in-PH) is a list of associates working on Philippine projects.
- **We use public tools** and will happily share our experiences and processes with local mappers to help grow communities.
- **We work with the local community.** Often when conducting groundwork in-situ we will try to meet local editors and collaborate with them when possible.  We seek to understand the local mapping conventions and assist in uplifting OSM data to a more complete standard.
